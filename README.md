This project is a card game that simulates two virtual computers playing the classic card game of War.  However, the program is not fully functional. There are 3 different bugs in the code that prevent it from running correctly. I detected these bugs by conducting unittest. Below is a brief description of the 5 main files this project contains.

code_description_507F17project1.txt - This file provides a code description of how the program is suppose to work including suspected output.

SI507F17_project1_cards.py - This is a description of how the program should run if the bugs were not present.

helper_functions.py - This contains helper functions for the main code in SI507F17_project1_cards.py.

SI507F17_project1_tests.py - This contains the projects unittest code that when run will highlight the three bugs of the curent program.

requirements.txt - Shows the required modules for this project.

This project was was of a homework assignment for SI 507 and the files SI507F17_project1_cards.py, helper_functions.py and code_description_507F17project1.txt were provided by the class instructor. The file SI507F17_project1_tests.py was the file that I contributed to highlight the bugs in the code.
